					When transporting goods and bulk commodity items over large distances, shipping by rail is an 
					ideal option. For one, it is cheaper and more energy efficient than trucks. The transport 
					industry is responsible for 1 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per year. Since 
					GHG emissions are directly related to fuel consumption, expanding the use of rail is a good way 
					to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without harming the economy.<sup>[Ibid]</sup> On average, railroads are 4 
					times more fuel efficient than trucks. That means moving freight by rail instead of truck 
					reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent. According to CER (Community European Railway and 
					Infrastructure Companies), if rail freight transport were doubled, with the freight shifted from 
					the road sector, it could result in a reduction of GHG emission of around 45-55 million tonnes 
					of CO<sub>2</sub> a year. And if say, railways were to be the primary mode of freight transport by 2050, 
					the estimated reduction would be 238 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, equivalent to 19 percent of 
					EU27 transport emissions in 2010.<sup>[1]</sup>

					"Transport is responsible for around 20% of all GHG emissions within the EU28, and rises to 20%
					if emissions from international aviation and maritime transport are fully taken into account. 
					It is the only sector where emissions have continued to rise since 1990. Rail accounts for
					just 0.6% of transport's GHG emissions through direct usage (diesel) and by around 1.5% if
					emissions from electricity generation are taken into account, even though railways represent
					8.5% of transport activity."

					"On average, rail is clearly more emissions-effficient and emits significantly
					lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than comparable models of transport. A doubling
					of rail freight transport, with the freight shifted from the road sector, could
					result in a reduction of GHG emissions of around 45-55 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>
					a year. The vision for much greater use of rail by 2050 outlined in "Roadmap to 
					a Single European Transport Area" would equate to around a 38% modal share rail
					freight transport and a 27% share for rail passenger transport. This would result
					in an estimated reduction of 238 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> a year, equivalent
					to 19% of EU27 transport emissions in 2010."

					"From 1990 to 2010, the total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from the European railway
					sector were reduced by 39%. The strategy commits European railways to reduce their
					specific CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 1990. In addition,
					by 2030 the European railways will cut their total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from
					train operation by 30% compared to the 1990 base year. Furthermore, by 2050 the
					European railways will strive towards complete carbon-free train operation, providing
					society with a climate-neutral transport option."
