						The Project of the 21st Century...

				<p>
					The Project of the 21st Century...
					The “Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road” or more 
					simply, “One Belt, One Road” (OBOR) is an infrastructure and development plan 
					that was pitched in late 2013 by China’s President Xi Jinping. The OBOR 
					initiative is rooted in the ancient Silk Road, but it is also open to all other 
					countries. Dubbed the “project of the century,” the $5 trillion infrastructure 
					project will link 65 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe by land and by sea 
					for trade and investment. OBOR is considered to be the most comprehensive 
					global initiative with many nations working together representing 63% of the 
					global population (4.4 billion people) and 29 percent of global GDP.
					<sup>[1]</sup>
				</p>

				<p>				
					There are 2 major components: one by land and the other by sea, the “Silk Road 
					Economic Belt” and the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road,” respectively. The 
					OBOR development plan shows that the cargo train service system will consist of 
					three routes – an east route, a central route and a west route – of the 
					Eurasian Land Bridge. The routes will not only connect China with Europe, but 
					also with East Asia and Southeast Asia. Some 43 transport hubs will be created 
					along the three routes and 43 railway lines will be built, according to the 
					plan.

                    Per the map graphic here<sup>[2]</sup> created by MERIC (The Mercator Institute for China 
					Studies), a Berlin-based thinktank that analyzes the political, economic, 
					social, technological and ecological developments in China, and the 
					corresponding global impacts, they have outlined the projects in developing 
					countries where China seeks to encourage investment as part of its One Belt, 
					One Road initiative.  As a key component of the Belt and Road initiative, 
					direct cargo trains will connect a growing number of cities in China and 
					Europe. Thus far, OBOR is part of a rapidly growing network consisting of 39 
					rail lines. Since 2011, various other lines connecting different cities have 
					been launched: Wuhan to Pardubice, Czech Republic in 2012; Chengdu to Lodz, 
					Poland in 2013; Zhengzhou to Hamburg, Germany in 2013; Suzhou to Warsaw, 
					Poland in 2013; Yiwu to Madrid, Spain in 2014; Wuhan to Hamburg in 2015; and 
					most recently, Yiwu to London, England in 2017.<sup>[3],</sup><sup>[4]</sup> 
					
					Once the rail cars arrive in the EU they can easily move on to other European 
					cities via the EU’s own version of a trans-national transport network: 
					Trans-European Transport Policy (TEN-T). Within the TEN-T network are the 
					Green Corridors, which are long-distance freight transport corridors where 
					advanced technology and co-modality are used to increase energy efficiency and 
					reduce environmental impact.<sup>[5]</sup>
